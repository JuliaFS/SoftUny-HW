/* Problem 10
 * Write a program to visualize the house and the points from
 * the image above as SVG graphic embedded into a HTML document.
 * The SVG format (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a
 * XML based format for describing vector graphics used in
 * the modern Web applications that supports drawing lines,
 * circles, ellipses, rectangles, paths and
 * other objects like text and raster images.
 * You may find in Internet some Java library to
 * build SVG graphics or you may build it through an
 * XML parser or by printing plain text.
 * You are free to choose the libraries and tools.
 *  * The coordinate axes should be thin dotted lines.
 *  * The coordinates should have numbers as above.
 *  * The house should consist of two rectangles and
 *      a triangle above them, with solid lines and 
 *      filled in semi-transparent gray color.
 *  * The points inside the house should be
 *  	painted as black circles.
 *  * The points outside the house should be painted as
 *  	gray circles with thin black border.
 * You are not allowed to use ready SVG, use Java code to draw everything!
 * Take as input the coordinates of the points
 * (the first line holds the number of points n and
 * the next n lines hold a point coordinates separated by a space).
 * Produce as output a file names house.html,
 * which visualizes the house and the points inside and
 * outside of it through an embedded SVG graphic
